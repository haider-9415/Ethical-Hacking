variables in shel programming

there are two types of variables 

1) system defined variables
          these are pre-defined by linux and in upper case

2) user defined variables
          these are defined by the users
          they can be in lower case and also in upper case
          in starting of this variable, $ sign is used to print its content

set, env & printenv are those commands which show the predifined variables
